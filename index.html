{% capture billboard_description %}

The Spring Shell project provides an interactive shell that allows you to 
plugin your own custom commands using a Spring based programming model.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

## 介绍

Users of the Spring Shell project can easily build a full featured shell ( *aka* command line)
application by depending on the Spring Shell jars and adding their own commands (which come as
methods on spring beans). Creating a command line application can be useful *e.g.* to
interact with your project's REST API, or to work with local file content.

## 特性
Spring Shell's features include

* A simple, annotation driven, [programming model](https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_writing_your_own_commands) to contribute custom commands
* Use of Spring Boot auto-configuration functionality as the basis for a command plugin strategy
* Tab completion, colorization, and script execution
* Customization of command prompt, shell history file name, handling of results and errors
* [Dynamic enablement](https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#dynamic-command-availability) of commands based on domain specific criteria
* Integration with the [bean validation API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#_validating_command_arguments)
* Already [built-in commands](https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/current-SNAPSHOT/reference/htmlsingle/#built-in-commands), such as clear screen, gorgeous help, exit
* ASCII art Tables, with formatting, alignment, fancy borders, *etc.*

## 快速开始


{% include download_widget.md %}

Then to create a simple command that could be invoked as

```
shell:>translate "hello world!" --from en_US --to fr_FR
bonjour monde!
```

assuming you'd have access to some kind of translation service that worked with Locales:

```java
package foo;

@ShellComponent
public class TranslationCommands {

    private final TranslationService service;

    @Autowired
    public TranslationCommands(TranslationService service) {
      this.service = service;
    }

    @ShellMethod"Translate text from one language to another.")
    public String translate(
      @ShellOption(mandatory = true) String text,
      @ShellOption(mandatory = true, defaultValue = "en_US") Locale from,
      @ShellOption(mandatory = true) Locate to
    ) {
      // invoke service
      return service.translate(text, from, to);
    }
}
```
